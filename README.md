# Learned in CS 260

**_Setting up the start up_**
I learned how to use git in VS code which I have never done before. I've always used either the command line or github desktop.

**_Simon HTML_**
I learned how to organize html elements effectivly using a header, main, and footer in the body of the html. I also learned how to organize a
table with a header when setting up the scores page of the simon clone.

**_Simon CSS_**
I learned how to effectively use bootstrap and css in tandem to create an asthetically appealing website. I thought it was a bit repetitive to reimplement the header and footer for each page so I am looking forward to getting into more modular designs with react. I also learned more about the bootstrap fluid container.
